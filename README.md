# Advisr Applicant Project

### Thanks for your interest in working with us at Advisr!
In order to evaluate engineering candidates' skill sets, we provide this small sample project for candidates to complete. There are two parts to implement, a backend API and a frontend web UI implementing the API.

## Requirements
Run the generate script to create `db/*.json` files to be used as the data for the app. These files contain businesses, campaigns, categories, locations, externalSystems, and externalSystemInstallations.

## Submission Requirements
1. Create a private fork of this repo or create a private repo of your own.
2. Write a README.md with specific instructions explaining all steps from cloning the repo to running the app.

## Technical Requirements
1. Backend should be built with Express.js
2. Frontend should be built with Vue.js

## Scenarios
The following scenarios are designed to build off of each other. They also increase in complexity from one to the next. It is not a requirement to complete all scenarios, but it is a requirement they are completed in order. If you are unable to complete a scenario, do not move ahead. Spend your efforts making the work you've completed the best it can be. On completion of each scenario, create a separate tag for the commit. Each scenario submission should have at least 1 commit and also instructions in a README.md on how to run the application for that scenario.

- [Scenario #1](./Scenario1.md) Showing the data on the page
- [Scenario #2](./Scenario2.md) Making the data more interactive
- [Scenario #3](./Scenario3.md) Loading external data

## Good luck! Please reach out with questions
We will schedule time for you to talk us through your completed project.
